# Spring Boot SQL Solution - TODO

## Plan Implementation Steps:

1. ✅ **Update SOLUTION_RESULTS table schema** - Modified to match required output format (SALARY, NAME, AGE, DEPARTMENT_NAME)

2. ✅ **Completely rewrite Application.java** - Replace existing complex implementation with solution for highest salary problem

3. ✅ **Test the application** - Run and verify the SQL query produces expected results

4. ✅ **Verify output format** - Confirm results match the required format

## ✅ SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION

**Results:**
- **SALARY:** $74998.00
- **NAME:** Emily Brown
- **AGE:** 32
- **DEPARTMENT:** Sales

**Analysis:**
- The highest salary ($74,998.00) was paid to Emily Brown on March 2nd, 2025
- This payment was correctly identified as it was NOT made on the 1st day of the month
- Age calculation: Emily Brown was born in 1992, so she's 32 years old (2025 - 1992 = 33, minus 1 because her birthday hasn't occurred yet in 2025)
- Department correctly identified as "Sales"
- All payment records were displayed for reference, showing that 1st day transactions were properly excluded from the highest salary calculation

## SQL Query to Implement:
```sql
SELECT
    p.AMOUNT as SALARY,
    CONCAT(e.FIRST_NAME, ' ', e.LAST_NAME) as NAME,
    YEAR(CURRENT_DATE) - YEAR(e.DOB) -
        CASE WHEN MONTH(CURRENT_DATE) < MONTH(e.DOB) OR
                  (MONTH(CURRENT_DATE) = MONTH(e.DOB) AND DAY(CURRENT_DATE) < DAY(e.DOB))
             THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as AGE,
    d.DEPARTMENT_NAME
FROM PAYMENTS p
JOIN EMPLOYEE e ON p.EMP_ID = e.EMP_ID
JOIN DEPARTMENT d ON e.DEPARTMENT = d.DEPARTMENT_ID
WHERE DAY(p.PAYMENT_TIME) != 1
ORDER BY p.AMOUNT DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Expected Output Format:
- SALARY: The highest salary amount (excluding 1st day transactions)
- NAME: Combined first and last name format "FirstName LastName"
- AGE: Calculated age of the employee
- DEPARTMENT_NAME: Name of the employee's department
